# A simple example showing how to hook up a pipeline with
# coroutines. To run this, you will need a log file.  Run the program
# logsim.py in the background to get a data source.

# A data source.  This is not a coroutine, but it sends data into one
# (target)

proc follow {thefile target} {
    seek $thefile 0 end
    while 1 {
        set len [gets $thefile line]
        if {$len < 0} {

            continue
        }
        $target $line
    }
}

# A sink. A coroutine that receives data

# Use a lambda expression instead of an existing proc for the
# coroutine
